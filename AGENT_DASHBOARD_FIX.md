# Agent Management Dashboard - Data Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Only "all" agent showing in agents section**
   - **Problem**: Metrics were aggregated into a single "all" agent instead of showing individual agents
   - **Root Cause**: Data transformation in `AgentOperations.tsx` (lines 122-130) created only one aggregate metric
   - **Solution**: Added `fetchPerAgentMetrics()` to data source and updated component to use per-agent data

### 2. **Blank activity graph**
   - **Problem**: Agent activity chart had no data points
   - **Root Cause**: Data format mismatch between `RecentAction` and `AgentAction` interfaces
   - **Solution**: Added data transformation in component to map `RecentAction` to `AgentAction` format

### 3. **Blank performance graph**
   - **Problem**: Agent performance chart had no data points
   - **Root Cause**: Same as activity graph - data format mismatch
   - **Solution**: Same transformation handles both charts

### 4. **Empty event stream**
   - **Problem**: Live event stream showed no events
   - **Root Cause**: Events depend on actions array, which had format issues
   - **Solution**: Transformation ensures events have proper data

## Changes Made

### 1. **agent-operations-source.ts**
   - Added `fetchPerAgentMetrics()` method to fetch individual agent metrics
   - Updated `AgentOperationsData` interface to include `perAgentMetrics: any[]`
   - Modified `fetchAll()` to fetch and return per-agent metrics

### 2. **agent-operations-mock.ts**
   - Added `generatePerAgentMetrics()` method to generate mock data for 10 agents:
     - CodeAnalyzer, TestGenerator, DeployAssistant, RefactorAgent, SecurityScanner
     - PerformanceOptimizer, DocumentationAgent, QualityValidator, IntegrationMonitor, AnalysisAssistant
   - Updated `generateRecentActions()` to use consistent agent names
   - Modified `generateAll()` to include per-agent metrics

### 3. **AgentOperations.tsx**
   - Updated metrics transformation to use `perAgentMetrics` when available (lines 122-141)
   - Added data transformation for actions to handle format mismatch (lines 143-158)
   - Removed duplicate `HealthStatus` interface that conflicted with import

## Data Format Details

### Per-Agent Metrics Format
```typescript
{
  agent: string,              // Agent name (e.g., "CodeAnalyzer")
  totalRequests: number,      // Total number of requests
  successRate: number,        // Decimal 0-1 format (e.g., 0.95 = 95%)
  avgRoutingTime: number,     // Average routing time in milliseconds
  avgConfidence: number       // Average confidence score 0-1
}
```

### RecentAction → AgentAction Transformation
```typescript
{
  id: action.id,
  correlationId: action.correlationId || action.id,
  agentName: action.agentName,
  actionType: action.actionType || action.action,
  actionName: action.actionName || action.action,
  actionDetails: action.actionDetails || {},
  debugMode: action.debugMode || false,
  durationMs: action.durationMs || action.duration,  // Key transformation
  createdAt: action.createdAt || action.timestamp    // Key transformation
}
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Start dev server**: `PORT=3000 npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:3000/
3. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Agent activity graph shows data points over 20 minutes
   - ✅ Agent performance graph shows execution time data
   - ✅ Agents section displays 10 individual agents (not just "all")
   - ✅ Live event stream shows recent events with agent names
   - ✅ Metric cards show aggregate statistics

## Expected Results

### Agents Grid
Should display 10 agents with individual stats:
- Each agent has status badge (active/idle/error)
- Success rate displayed as percentage
- Quality score based on confidence
- Response time in milliseconds
- Tasks completed count

### Activity Chart
- 20 data points representing last 20 minutes
- Shows actions per minute
- Updates as new mock actions are generated

### Performance Chart
- 20 data points representing last 20 minutes
- Shows average execution time in milliseconds
- Area chart with smooth gradient

### Event Stream
- Lists recent actions with timestamps
- Shows agent name as source
- Action name as message
- Color-coded by status (info/success/warning/error)

## Mock Data Configuration

Mock data is enabled via `.env`:
```bash
VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=true
```

When enabled, the system generates:
- 10 agents with realistic metrics
- 50 recent actions spread across last 60 minutes
- Consistent agent names across metrics, actions, and events

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility with real API data
- Transformation layer handles both mock and real data formats
- No changes required to API endpoints or database schema
- Changes are purely in frontend data handling layer
